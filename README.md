====================

EECE 381 Android Project created November 27, 2014.

Authors: Lucas Gomes, Rayaan Choudri, Kaibo Ma and Emmett Tan.

This is our music sequencing android app. Up to four users can connect to each other, create loops,  and make music collaboratively on their smartphone. This project was made on a Altera DE2 Board, so the multi-user features are unavailable. See a video demo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI8SVcV2FZ8

If there is interest in a live version of this, we might consider working further on this project.

Source Code
====================

Feel free to download the source code and run the android app. When at the middleman connection screen that asks for an IP, just click "Individual Session" and pick your instruments, tempo and key and loop settings. Tempo is not complete yet, and loop configuration is buggy. 

Don't bother with the other de2 files. Even if you have a de2, it is difficult to set up the full project, and it won't be worth it unless you have the LED strip and parts necessary to set up the circuit. If you are interested, email me and I will step you through the process. UBCEmmettTan@gmail.com
